# *SYNTH_OF_SELF*
``` 
This project explores the enchanting properties of technological horror  
in the form of auditory embodiment, powered by Computer Vision and Audio Synthesis software.  

The goal is to investigate how one grapples with individual agency  
in a world dominated by technology; where the only source of information and orientation  
comes from remote, mysterious, hidden computerized processes.  
  
I reccomend watching the following demonstration video before continuing:

By introducing a dissonant soundscape which is determined by the positions of people  
in the SYNTH OF SELF space, auditory intrusions are in fact disruptions  
to the process of our bodily translation to the digital domain  
(and by extension, disruptions to the body).  
  
Computer Vision in itself is known to be a controversial technology.   
In the case of facial recognition, Computer Vision necessarily brutalizes the organic features  
of the human face into numerical metrics, to be permanently taken and written upon the registers  
of some unknown, faraway machine memory.  
The face, which is in much effect the way we are known to the world, is taken painlessly,  
invisibly, and later embedded upon doped silicon buried somewhere within the earth.  
  
This burial in many ways is a death of its own; to be embodied into a digital space  
is to lose one's entirety of expression.  
The rendition of the painting contains the power to resurrect the dead.  
What happens when this is done millions and millions of times over,  
frame by frame of the flickering display,  
before physical death?  
Our bodies are compromised by computer interfaces, and yet  
we remain societally captivated by their development 
(perhaps gripped by a similar sort of horror).  
An intended effect of this project is for it's participants to question  
whether they can ever be encapsulated outside of their simple being.
