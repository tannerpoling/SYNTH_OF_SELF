looking at fixing things up to work on this project some more
1. get things running on one computer
- need to be able to install libraries on computer
  - 2 options. either run everything in touchdesigner or have separate python process
    - everything in touch pros:
      - no more need for tcp/ip shenanigans
      - *seems* easier to manage libraries in touch... all dependencies in one place
    - cons: 
      - a fair bit of restructuring
      - touch is largely single-threaded... complex opencv processing will slow down all visuals
    - separate python process pros:
      - literally just need to get libraries running on windows, and update the tcp/ip info.
      - probably more robust to touchdeisgner updates
    - cons:
      - getting opencv running on windows has been impressively hard in the past

- just get python packages running on windows
  - powershell doesn't recognize python... try cygwin
