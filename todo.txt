1. install python packages
  - DONE opencv
  - DONE synth

2. DONE basic synth manipulation
  - DONE multithreading for multiple synths
  - DONE vary pitch with time / changing variable
    - make an iterable that only returns one variable
    - have this variable be updated by opencv processing a frame
    - working on making a varying synth that doesn't pop/click
      - have a sine wave going for a while, then make a ramp up
        - have sinusoid(base freq) * some gain [ just do what chirp example does ]
        - grab current value of gain, use line() to make ramp from there to end value
  - make pitch adjustment more robust\
    - upper / lower bounds of pitch
    - rate of change bounds
  - vary modulation with time / changing variable

3. DONE basic opencv object detection
  - big objects / fast recognition
    - YOLO?
      - wayyyyy over kill
    - assign position / center coordinate
    - export numerical value
      - try drawing on screen
  - idea of tracking unique objects over time?
  - maybe try adapting calibration work from APL
    - have a script that runs, adjusts parameters to get "best" detection,
      then saves that to some sort of config file that can be loaded in
      and run on the original video

4. DONE opencv -> synth (one object)
  - take value of 1 object position -> control synth
    - probably just do biggest object in view?
  - vidmodule detects, returns keypoints. needs to be passed to synthmodule
    - synthmodule then checks number of current synths vs number of blobs before starting any new synths?
    - need some sort of update method in synthmodule that runs every frame, updates pitch and mod of each synth

5. DONE opencv -> synth (multiple object)
  - calibrate termination criteria for multiple objects
  - each one controls a separate synth

5a. Improve code
  - unique object tracking
    - mapping unique objects to an assigned synth
  - more robust tracking algo (not just using blob detection)
  - trying smoother pitch transitions
    - syncing image processing with making ramps to smoothly transition pitch
      - need to enforce time delay between frames being processed
      

6. get feedback
  - dxarts profs
  - students (post on ig?)

7. get a demo together
  - look into visuals
    - idea: visualization based on number of sounds, pitches, harmony
      - kind of psychedelic theme
      - starting in center of each wall in the room, expanding outwards
      - 1 synth -> circular
      - 2 synth -> line?
      - 3 synth -> triangle, and so on
      - stability of lines, colors, or volume can depend on harmony
    - maybe see if someone else wants to work on that part


8. propose to art people / find a space for an exhibit

9. promo?
  - animation of eyes opening and closing, inside eye is audio visualization stuff?
