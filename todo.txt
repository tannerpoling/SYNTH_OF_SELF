1. install python packages
  - DONE opencv
  - synth

2. basic synth manipulation
  - vary pitch with time / changing variable
  - vary modulation with time / changing variable

3. basic opencv object detection
  - big objects / fast recognition
    - YOLO?
      - wayyyyy over kill
    - assign position / center coordinate
    - export numerical value
      - try drawing on screen
  - idea of tracking unique objects over time?
  - maybe try adapting calibration work from APL
    - have a script that runs, adjusts parameters to get "best" detection,
      then saves that to some sort of config file that can be loaded in
      and run on the original video

4. opencv -> synth (one object)
  - take value of 1 object position -> control synth
    - probably just do biggest object in view?

5. opencv -> synth (multiple object)
  - calibrate termination criteria for multiple objects
  - each one controls a separate synth
    - use multi-threading

6. get feedback
  - dxarts profs
  - students (post on ig?)

7. get a demo together
  - look into visuals
    - idea: visualization based on number of sounds, pitches, harmony
      - kind of psychedelic theme
      - starting in center of each wall in the room, expanding outwards
      - 1 synth -> circular
      - 2 synth -> line?
      - 3 synth -> triangle, and so on
      - stability of lines, colors, or volume can depend on harmony
    - maybe see if someone else wants to work on that part


8. propose to art people / find a space for an exhibit

9. promo?
  - animation of eyes opening and closing, inside eye is audio visualization stuff?
